Overview of the Project
The project is about Steve’s parents who would like to invest in green energy and are going to be the first client to their son Steve, who just graduated college with a Finance degree. They want to invest all their fund in DAQA New energy Corp and wants Steve to handle the transaction. Steve wants to diversify his parents fund and he is analyzing the green energy and DQ stocks. Steve needs help with this and created an excel file asked us to help.
For this project, we will use an extension of excel, Visual basic for application (VBA) that is used to automate tasks will be used. VBA is a programming language that interacts with excel and in this Project, VBA was used to read and write excel in excel worksheet, made calculation, and used to perform analysis with this complex project.
Results
All the stock’s performance in 2017 was good except TERP; Stock return in 2017 was good, the stock market was good except TERP but in 2018, stock market performance dropped but ENPH and RUN return was good, ENPH’s return was 81.9% and RUN return 84.0%
DQ has the highest return in 2017 but in 2018 dropped. ENPH has a positive return in 2017 and 2018. In 2017 ENPH grew by 129.1% and 81.9% in 2018. Based on the stock performance of ENPH, which was sustained in both years, I would recommend it to be purchased by Steve’s parents. 
The execution times for the original script for 2017 was 0.78125 seconds and in 2018, it was 0.75 seconds. For the execution times for the refactored script, in 2017 was 0.171875 seconds and in 2018, 0.160625 seconds The execution time was faster for the refactored script. The refactored script ran faster than the original script. See image below.

3. Summary
I. The advantages of refactoring codes are as follows
a)	Refactoring cleans up the code and makes it a better-quality code, changes structure but the functions are same and makes it easier to improve and update codes.
b)	It makes it easier to understand as it reduces the complexity.
c)	It also makes it easier to maintain.
d)	Run time for refactored script was faster than the original script run time. For example, in 2017, the original script run time was 0.78125 seconds where refactored script 2017 run time was 0.15625 seconds which is faster.
The disadvantage of Refactoring code.
a)	Refactoring is time consuming, takes a long time to achieve and can keep you stranded, and you would know what and where to go.
b)	Retesting the functionality to ensure everything functions as it should.
II. Refactoring the original VBA script cleaned up the code to a better-quality code and made it easier to understand. However, it is time consuming and at some points I did not know what to do but eventually figured it out.
Refactoring codes reduces run time thereby saving time. The original script ran for 0.78125 seconds in 2017 and 0.75 seconds in 2018 while refactored script ran for 0.171875 seconds in 2017 and 0.1640625 seconds in 2018. In conclusion, refracted script ran faster than original script.
